// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible
// to COM components.  If you need to access a type in this assembly from
// COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

//      Major Version
//      Minor Version

[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]

// To-Do List (All Done!)
// - Set the copyright.
// - Set the GUID. It's like a social security number, but for code.
// - Set the version to 1.0.0.0. Because we're optimistic.
